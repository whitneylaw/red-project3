        Okanagan Crush Pad Wines
      </h1>
      <section class="introduction">
        Our wines are crafted naturally using state-of-the-art concrete tanks, native yeast, and minimal additives, by Chief Winemaker, Matt Dumayne. The wines reflect the region's unique high mountain/northern desert setting noted for its intensely hot, short growing season with hallmark cool evenings. In their constant pursuit of innovation, the team added a line of wine-based spirits under the Narrative label in 2015. Visitors discover a guest center, built into the heart of the winery, offering a rare glance into the art of winemaking and a place where they can sample and purchase a wide range of wines and spirits under our Haywire and Narrative brands.

          <p class="specs">pH 3.70 | TA 6.3 | RS 1.1 | Alc. 13.4%</p>
          <p class="wine-description">This wine is made from Pinot Gris grapes grown at Switchback Vineyard in Summerland, and Secrest Vineyard, a cool, mountain setting in Oliver. In keeping with our tradition of less is more, this wine is 100% stainless steel fermented. Dry but juicy, and bursting with citrus notes, intriguing sweet and savoury herbs and demanding of food that is loaded with the same. Pair with fresh shellfish, spicy curries, roast chicken or enjoy on its own.</p>

          <p class="wine-description">The 2014 Wild Ferment is 100% Switchback Pinot Gris. The grapes were harvested October 21, pressed and put into an 800-litre Amphora to ferment on native yeast with zero winemaking intervention. This wine was left of the skins for eight months, pressed and then left to rest for an additional two months before being filtered and bottled in August 2015. No SO2 or other additives were used in this wine.</p>

          <p class="specs">pH 3.71 | TA 5.6 | RS 0.6 | Alc. 13.2%</p>
          <p class="wine-description">This wine started with low crop levels, extreme patience during harvest, and slave-like manual punch downs in the tanks. It was aged in old French oak barrels then moved into egg-shaped concrete tanks for further rest time.  The wine has the hallmark cherry fruit intensity of the previous vintage, with soft, lush tannins and will continue to improve and evolve with bottle ageing.  Pair with soft ripe cheeses, hearty stews and game meats.</p>
